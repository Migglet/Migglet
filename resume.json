    "summary": "I've been working in the industry for about 20 years now. I have had the pleasure of working with some brilliant people along the way, and we've done some really cool projects. My favorite projects are the kind you're not sure you can actually pull off. Often the unexpected can occur, but success is mandatory. So you use your resources and tools and hand craft a solution, and it works for me. I like to push the envelope. \n\nI have been keeping busy working with various customers both large and small.  Some projects are simple, others more complicated.  I recently collaborated with a virtual team to complete a key feature for a flagship store launch in both NY and LA.  Not being able to be on site was a challenge but the correct solution was implemented and it was up and live on time.\n\nI am definitely a problem solver, but I’d rather prevent them.",
